//The local movie theater in town has a ticket price of $12.00 but if you are a senior (55 and older), under 10 you get the discounted price of $7.00. 
//In addition, if a customer is seeing a movie between 3pm and 5pm they can also get the discounted price.
//Determine which of the two prices the customer is eligible for.

var age = Number(prompt("Enter your Age", 0)); //prompts user to Enter thier age
var time = Number(prompt("Enter the time you seeing the Movie", 0)); //promts user to Enter movie time
var regTicketPrice = 12; //regular movie time ticket price
var discountTime = [3,4,5] //movie discount times 
var senior = 55; //senior age discount
var child = 10; //child age discount

regTicketPrice = (age < senior && age > child && time != 3 && time != 4 && time != 5 ) ? "The ticket price is $" + regTicketPrice : "The ticket price is $" + (regTicketPrice - 5);
